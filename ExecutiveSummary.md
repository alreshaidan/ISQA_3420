#ExecutiveSummary

  The main purpose of this project is to ensure the quality and licensing information
of each project that are either under development or already developed by some company.
Developer and Manager is two primary actors of this system. Developer can get the license
information of software packages he is using in the development of some project. 
He can also submit his software project for vulnerability and license testing. He can also
get the information about the policy details of any project he is going to develop. 
Manager can create and update the policy of each project. He also gets the report 
of vulnerability and license issues involved in some project. He also manages the
request of each developer for policy, vulnerability and licensing.


  In the past, there is no system that assures the quality of each project. There 
is no solution to check the vulnerability of the code. This project can help the
organization to access all the information regarding licensing and code and software
packages used within the company. It also avoids the company from major copyright issues.
